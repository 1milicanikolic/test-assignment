In this repo, you will find:
a) Task1A - Automation task number 1
b) Task2A - Automation task number 2 - I used cypress, but Postman would be able to do the test too. 
c) Task1M - Manual testing task number 1
d) Task2M - Manual testing task number 2

Cypress testing was performed in Google Chrome, and in headless mode it was performed in Electron.
